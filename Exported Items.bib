	abstract = {Salmonella is a globally important pathogen that actively invades and replicates within host cells, including epithelial cells and macrophages, during infection. Bacterial internalization is predominantly orchestrated by the Salmonella SPI-1 Type III secretion system (T3SS). The SPI-1 T3SS transports effectors directly through the host cell membrane and into its cytosol to trigger Salmonella uptake. Here, we demonstrate that Salmonella rapidly synthesizes SPI-1 components as they encounter potential host macrophages, priming the bacteria for host invasion. Assembly of the T3SS in the host membrane results in transient pore formation. We show that this leads to the surge of translational induction of host transcription factors, including Egr1. In macrophages, the rapid synthesis of EGR1 results in the suppression of immune response and pro-apoptotic genes. Thus, SPI-1-mediated membrane damage limits the macrophage immune response to Salmonella infection},

	abstract = {PRK1 is a member of the protein kinase C-related kinase (PRK) family of serine/threonine kinases and a downstream effector of Rho GTPases. PRK1 has three N-terminal Homology Region 1 (HR1) domains (HR1a, HR1b and HR1c), which form antiparallel coiled coils that interact with Rho family GTPases. PRK1 also has a C2-like domain that targets it to the plasma membrane and a kinase domain, which is a member of the protein kinase C superfamily. PRK1 is involved in cytoskeletal regulation, cell adhesion, cell cycle progression and the immune response, and is implicated in cancer. There is currently no structural information for the HR1c domain. The 1H, 15N and 13C NMR backbone and sidechain resonance assignment of the HR1c domain presented here forms the basis for this domain’s structural characterisation. This work will also enable studies of interactions between the three HR1 domains in an effort to obtain structural insight into the regulation of PRK1 activity.},

	abstract = {Translational recoding events, such as programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), are critical regulatory processes that enable the production of multiple proteins from a single mRNA transcript in a finely tuned manner. PRF plays a pivotal role in the gene expression of many viruses, making it an attractive therapeutic target. While the cis-acting elements that drive many recoding events are well-characterized, the impact of the cellular environment on these elements remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we developed an RNA-based dual-fluorescence reporter system that enables real-time monitoring of translational recoding events across a wide range of cell types, including physiologically relevant cell types. This system permits for the quantification of the kinetics of in-trans modulation of frameshift efficiency, providing crucial insights into how cellular context influences recoding events. We validated the system’s ability to accurately monitor the frameshift efficiency of signals from SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1 and the human gene PEG10 in live cells, revealing striking differences in frameshift efficiency between cell types, specific to each frameshift cassette. Importantly, this platform offers a robust foundation for large-scale drug screening in physiologically relevant cell types. It not only facilitates the identification of compounds that modulate translational recoding but also enables the assessment of drug entry and activity across different cell types. This dual capability is essential for evaluating the potential efficacy of therapeutic candidates and ensuring that drug effects are accurately measured in biologically meaningful contexts.},

	abstract = {The apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is known to manipulate its host in multiple ways, ranging from proteins secreted into the host cell to hormone balance disruption and behavioral changes. Host immune system is crucial in managing the outcome with macrophages as part of the first line of defense. However, the initial triggers that ultimately result in characteristic complex responses and, at times, health hazards, remain poorly understood. This study focuses on filling the gaps in our knowledge of acute transcriptomic changes taking place in a mouse macrophage T. gondii infection model. We performed time-resolved transcriptomic profiling to simultaneously capture host and parasite gene expression profiles during the course of infection, focusing on the initial time frame of fifteen to 120 minutes, a crucial window for the host to activate innate immunity but also for the parasite to establish within the host macrophage. Further, utilization of inactivated parasite stimulation enabled dissection of transcriptomic response to active parasite infection from innate immune responses. Here, we observed that macrophages upregulate transcripts encoding suppressors of cytokine signaling by 30 minutes, specific to live parasite infection. Additionally, both pro-growth and stress marker genes were dysregulated. Concurrently, transcriptional response of T. gondii was milder in magnitude, with initial changes pointing at increasing transcription and growth capacity, followed by a delayed transcriptional response pertaining to secreted proteins. Taken together, these results demonstrate that macrophages mount a rapid transcriptional response upon active invasion by T. gondii. In contrast, the delayed transcriptional activation in the invading Toxoplasma highlights its reliance on alternative regulatory mechanisms to establish its replicative niche within the host.
Author summary Toxoplasma gondii, a eukaryotic intracellular parasite, is often regarded as one of the most globally successful parasites because it can infect virtually any warm-blooded animal. It uses a repertoire of secretory proteins to gain a foothold in a host cell, often resulting in a dormant infection in vivo due to sufficient immune suppression. However, the timing of the signaling events as Toxoplasma invades is not yet fully understood. In this work we implement our user-friendly transcriptomic method to simultaneously capture T. gondii and murine macrophage protein-coding RNA contents over a time course to track cellular responses during infection. In particular, we focus on the first 2 hours of infection, a time window where the initial transcriptomic changes within macrophage are generally expected to take place and potentially define further course of infection. Our analysis reveals a robust host macrophage immune response and a moderate more gradual T. gondii response. These findings complement the currently existing picture of all the cellular regulation layers involved in Toxoplasma–macrophage interaction.},

	abstract = {Changes in gene expression during bacterial infection are the combined result of altered transcription and translation, with the latter comparatively understudied. Gram-negative bacteria rapidly trigger cytokine gene transcription in macrophages through the activation of pathogen associated molecular pattern receptors, for example detection of Salmonella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the bacterial cell envelope by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Here, through time-resolved parallel translatomic and transcriptomic profiling, we now show temporal TLR4-specific translational upregulation of cell signalling proteins in macrophages induced by Salmonella. While transcriptional upregulation of these genes is dampened through the activity of the Salmonella SPI-1 type three secretion system, a robust translational response remains. These data reveal an important host-pathogen translational regulatory network that modifies the innate immune response of macrophages to infection.},
